      <p className="mb-3">
        After exploring my interests in high school, I decided to pursue my
        passion for math and programming.
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem, and actually
        apply my skills to solve real-world issues.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        various sports, whether it is basketball, badminton, or soccer.
        Throughout high school, I was on my school's varsity team and even won a
        bronze metal at OFSAA Provincials for badminton!
